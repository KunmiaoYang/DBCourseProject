##  Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a database management system for Wolf Inns. Our system can manage the following information:
+ Hotel information: hotel ID, hotel, name, hotel address, hotel phone number, hotel manager ID
+ Customer information: customer name, date of birth, contact information
+ Staff information: staff ID, name, age, job title , department, contact information, hotel currently serving
+ Room information: room number, room category, max occupancy, nightly rate, availability;
+ Billing information: customer ID, SSN of the person responsible for the payment, billing address, payment information
+ Check-in information: customer name and date of birth, hotel ID, room number, number of guests, start date, end date, check-in time, check-out time, services
offered.<br>

One big challenge is to create a lot of complex SQL code, like create tables and queries. If you want more information about our SQL code, please open this [link](https://github.com/KunmiaoYang/DBCourseProject/blob/master/schema.sql).
